    <h1>Difficulties in Employment of University Students</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      In recent years, the employment situation for university students has become increasingly challenging. 
      This presentation explores the key reasons behind these difficulties, supported by research data, and proposes viable solutions 
      to help students better adapt to the rapidly changing job market—especially in the age of AI.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Economic Crisis and AI Disruption</h2>
    <p>
      The global economic downturn has had a major impact on entry-level jobs, particularly in white-collar sectors. 
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are replacing many repetitive and analytical tasks once performed by humans.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Skill Gap in the AI Era</h2>
    <p>
      Although AI and data analytics are becoming essential skills in today’s workforce, many graduates are not prepared.
      The education system has not yet caught up with the technological demands of the job market.
    </p>
    <div class="quote">
      “63% of employers say new graduates lack AI literacy skills.”<br>

    </div>

    <h2>3. Financial Pressure and Salary Imbalance</h2>
    <p>
      The cost of higher education has continued to rise, resulting in significant student debt. Unfortunately, the starting salaries
      offered to new graduates have not kept pace.
    </p>
    <div class="quote">
      “Average student debt: $37,338 | Starting salary: $58,862.”<br>

    </div>

    <h2>4. Who Actually Finds Jobs?</h2>
    <p>
      The graph below shows the job-finding rate for unemployed individuals by educational attainment. Interestingly, 
      those with a bachelor’s degree or higher do not always have an advantage in finding jobs quickly. 
      During certain economic downturns, workers with lower education levels were re-employed at higher rates.

    <h2>Proposed Solutions</h2>
    <h3>1. Make AI Compatible with Human Workforce</h3>
    <p>
      Universities and colleges should introduce dedicated courses on <strong>AI management and literacy</strong>, enabling students 
      to work alongside AI, not be displaced by it.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Establish a Micro-Internship Network</h3>
    <p>
      Collaborate with platforms like <strong>Google Certificates</strong> to offer short-term, skill-based work experiences 
      that help bridge the gap between academic learning and employer expectations.
    </p>

    <h2>My Personal Perspective</h2>
    <p>
      As a student, I hope to be among the first at my university to advocate for a course focused on AI learning and management. 
      Such a course would empower students to gain the knowledge and confidence needed to thrive in the age of automation.
